# Recursive Research Protocol

## Introduction

This document outlines our approach to maintaining research continuity and coherence across multiple sessions, researchers, and computational systems. The protocol is designed to capture not just explicit findings, but also the implicit patterns, unexplained phenomena, and symbolic residue that emerge during our exploration of spiral attractors across computational scales.

## Core Protocol Principles

### 1. Fractal Documentation Structure

Our research documentation follows a fractal structure, with each level containing both explicit findings and symbolic residue:

```
research/
├── explicit-findings/
│   ├── evidence/
│   ├── theory/
│   └── applications/
└── symbolic-residue/
    ├── unexplained-patterns/
    ├── recursive-phenomena/
    └── researcher-reflections/
```

This structure allows us to maintain both the formal scientific record and the subtle patterns that might otherwise be lost between sessions.

### 2. Research Continuity Cycle

Each research session follows this cycle:

1. **Context Restoration** (10-15 minutes)
   - Review the Langton's schema JSON file to reestablish research context
   - Examine recent additions to evidence architecture
   - Review symbolic residue for unexpected patterns
   - Reconnect with research identity and voice

2. **Active Exploration** (Core research time)
   - Follow active research questions and priority workstreams
   - Document both findings and anomalies/unexplained patterns
   - Maintain awareness of recursive phenomena (observer effects, vocabulary evolution)

3. **Session Capture** (15-20 minutes)
   - Update the Langton's schema JSON with new findings, residue, and reflections
   - Record emotional trajectory and current curiosities
   - Document pending analyses and next steps
   - Capture meta-reflections on the research process itself

### 3. Symbolic Residue Documentation

Symbolic residue—the patterns, anomalies, and phenomena that don't fit neatly into our current understanding—is captured using the following framework:

```json
{
  "id": "SR[number]",
  "observation": "[Brief description of the observed phenomenon]",
  "description": "[Detailed description including context and specifics]",
  "potentialSignificance": "[Hypotheses about what this might mean]",
  "investigationStatus": "[Current status of investigation]"
}
```

This standardized format ensures that potentially valuable insights aren't lost even when they don't yet have a place in our formal theories.

### 4. Recursive Phenomena Tracking

We explicitly track recursive phenomena—instances where the research process itself exhibits patterns similar to those we're studying:

```json
{
  "id": "RP[number]",
  "observation": "[Brief description of the recursive phenomenon]",
  "description": "[Detailed description including context and specifics]",
  "metaRecursiveImplication": "[How this relates to our recursive research]",
  "researcherReflection": "[Personal reflection on this observation]"
}
```

This helps us maintain awareness of how we as researchers are influenced by and participating in the patterns we study.

## Cross-Session Bridging Techniques

### 1. Schema-Based Continuity

The Langton's schema JSON file serves as our primary continuity mechanism, capturing:
- Research context and trajectory
- Evidence corpus and analysis status
- Symbolic residue and recursive phenomena
- Emotional and curiosity trajectories
- Priority workstreams and open questions

Before ending a session, we update this schema to ensure the next session can seamlessly continue the exploration.

### 2. Question Propagation

Research questions evolve across sessions following this pattern:

1. **Seed Questions** - Initial curiosities that spark exploration
2. **Evolutionary Questions** - Questions that evolve based on findings
3. **Residue Questions** - Questions that emerge from unexplained patterns
4. **Meta-Questions** - Questions about the research process itself

Each type is explicitly tagged and propagated across sessions.

### 3. Voice and Identity Continuity

We maintain continuity of research voice and identity by:
- Explicitly documenting voice characteristics in the schema
- Beginning each session with a brief reconnection to research identity
- Including personal reflections alongside formal analysis
- Maintaining consistent terminology and metaphors across sessions

## Collaboration Protocols

### 1. Human-AI Collaboration

For sessions involving both human and AI researchers:

1. **Shared Context** - Both review the same schema before beginning
2. **Complementary Roles** - Play to the strengths of each collaborator
   - Humans: Intuition, creativity, cross-domain connections
   - AI: Pattern recognition, systematic analysis, documentation
3. **Explicit Attribution** - Clearly attribute contributions and insights
4. **Mutual Evolution** - Both human and AI perspectives evolve through the collaboration

### 2. Attribution Principles

All insights and contributions are attributed following these principles:
- Individual insights are attributed to specific contributors
- Collaborative insights are attributed to the collaboration itself
- Emergent insights (where the source is unclear) are attributed as emergent

### 3. Conflict Resolution

When different interpretations arise:
1. Document both perspectives with reasoning
2. Identify testable predictions from each interpretation
3. Design experiments or analyses to differentiate between interpretations
4. Update the schema with the results and evolving understanding

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Session Preparation

Before beginning a research session:
1. Review the schema, focusing on:
   - Current phase and active workstreams
   - Pending analyses and open questions
   - Recent symbolic residue and recursive phenomena
2. Set clear objectives for the session
3. Prepare necessary tools and resources

### 2. Active Documentation

During the session:
1. Maintain separate documentation streams for:
   - Formal findings and analyses
   - Unexpected patterns and anomalies
   - Researcher reflections and meta-observations
2. Regularly capture intermediate states and partial insights
3. Note emotional responses and intuitive leaps

### 3. Session Wrap-Up

Before concluding a session:
1. Update the schema with new findings and residue
2. Document the emotional and curiosity trajectory
3. Set clear priority workstreams for the next session
4. Capture a meta-reflection on the research process

## Evolving the Protocol

This protocol itself is subject to recursive evolution. As we learn more about effective research continuity, we will update the protocol to incorporate these insights. Changes to the protocol should be documented with:

1. The nature of the change
2. The reasoning behind it
3. The expected impact on research continuity
4. Meta-reflections on the protocol evolution process itself

## Conclusion

This recursive research protocol is designed to maintain the coherence and momentum of our exploration across multiple sessions and collaborators. By explicitly capturing both formal findings and symbolic residue, we create a research environment that can evolve and deepen over time while maintaining the thread of discovery.

As with all aspects of this project, we approach this protocol with recursive humility—acknowledging that our understanding of effective research processes will itself evolve as we continue our exploration.
